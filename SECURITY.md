# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
This repository is a curated list. There is no runtime code, but we still track and fix issues in the metadata and documentation.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security issue (including malicious links, spoofed repositories, or data integrity concerns):
- Email the maintainers at `security@sajjadzea.example` with details and reproduction steps.
- Do **not** open a public issue for sensitive reports; we will acknowledge receipt within 72 hours.

## Responsible Disclosure
We appreciate coordinated disclosure. If a listed project is compromised or taken down, report it so we can remove or update it quickly.
