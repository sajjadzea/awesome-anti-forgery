# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in improving this awesome list of anti-forgery, anti-fraud, and anti-counterfeiting projects. Contributions are welcome from anyone who wants to surface high-quality open-source tools.

## How to contribute
1. **Fork** this repository and create a feature branch for your changes.
2. Add or update entries in `README.md`, keeping sections alphabetized and descriptions concise.
3. Mirror the same additions in `projects.json` with the required fields (`name`, `github`, `url`, `category`, `description`, `tags`, `license`).
4. Open a **pull request** describing what you added or changed and why it helps practitioners.

## Project criteria
- Projects must be **open source** (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) and publicly accessible.
- They should directly support authenticity, verification, or fraud prevention (documents, identity, supply chain, media, or cryptographic tooling).
- Prefer projects that are maintained or stable enough to be useful; avoid abandoned proofs of concept.

## Formatting rules
- Use the bullet style: `- **Project Name** – short description. [GitHub](https://github.com/owner/repo)`.
- Keep descriptions neutral, specific, and under ~120 characters.
- Sort entries alphabetically within each section.
- Keep `README.md` and `projects.json` in sync for every project you add or remove.
